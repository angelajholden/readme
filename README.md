This is a simple, clean [project type, e.g., blog site, landing page, portfolio] built with HTML, CSS, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Itâ€™s based on a [Photoshop/Figma] mockup called **[Mockup Name and Link]** â€” purchased from [Envato/ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/).

The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from.
Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes a [brief highlight: e.g., custom CSS masonry layout, animation effects, or accessibility focus].

_This project is part of a free, open-source series focused on helping newer developers practice HTML/CSS with real-world examples._
