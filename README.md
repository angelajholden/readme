[![Watch the Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Watch-1E9FB4.svg?style=flat&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiEcEGGtRVumb3GPMVk2JYG687ysA3vN9)

This is a simple, clean blog site built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Itâ€™s based on a Photoshop mockup called [Ocean â€“ Personal Blog Template for Travelers and Dreamers](https://themeforest.net/item/ocean-personal-blog-template-for-travelers-and-dreamers-/15702539), purchased from Envato/ThemeForest.

The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code â€” and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from.  
Itâ€™s mobile responsive and includes a custom CSS masonry layout for the blog archive, which Iâ€™m especially proud of.

_This project is part of a free, open-source series focused on helping newer developers practice HTML/CSS with real-world examples._
