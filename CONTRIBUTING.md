# Contributing

## Thanks for your interest in contributing!

This repository reflects code written live on stream and used in project videos. Contributions are welcome, but there are a few important guidelines to keep everything aligned and easy to follow.

## Source of truth

- The `main` branch matches what was built live on stream and in the accompanying project video.
- Code in `main` should stay in sync with the stream and video content.

## Commits (helpful, not required)

- If your PR includes multiple types of changes (CSS, JS, docs), separate commits by concern when possible.
- Keep refactors separate from functional changes.
- If that’s hard for a small fix, one clean commit is totally fine.

## Pull requests

- Please create a **new branch** for all changes.
- Do not commit directly to `main`.
- Keep pull requests small and focused.
- Include a short description of _why_ the change is helpful.

## Scope and intent

- Architectural changes (for example: static → dynamic, refactors, framework changes) should be discussed **before** submitting a PR.
- Refactors that change teaching intent or project scope may be moved to an alternate branch instead of being merged into `main`.

## Alternate approaches

- Alternate implementations are welcome.
- These may live in a separate branch (for example: `alt-approach`, `experimental`, or similar).
- The existence of an alternate branch does not imply that it will replace the stream version.

## Documentation

- If your change affects behavior, structure, or usage, please update the README or relevant documentation.
- PRs may be closed or adjusted if documentation is missing.

## Final notes

- Not all PRs will be merged.
- My goal is clarity, and that code matches what happened on stream.

Thanks for contributing and for being part of my community!
